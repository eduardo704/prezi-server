# prezi-server

This Project is the support server for the prezi assigment project


It is a simple node js server

it should start by running

**npm run dev**

I confiugred it to run on port 8001 but it can be changed on the server.js file


I chose node over other backend server side technologies because even thuogh I am more familiar with java and in this case spring boot I saw it was not on the job description so I chose one that at least I know the language and it seems really simple for the task given.
